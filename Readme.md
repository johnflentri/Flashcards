## Requirements

You have to build a flash card app. Flash cards are cards with a question on one side an an answer on the other. It's a tool used to learn vocabulary words when learning languages for example. You're making an app where people can make digital flashcards of which they can see the question and answer.

## Userstories

1. As a student I want to see a random question so I can test myself
2. As a student I want to access the flashcard app from the internet so I can test myself anywhere I am (you can put the website online using netlify or github pages).
3. As a student I want to see the answer to the question so I can see if I was right.
4. As a student I want to get a new questions without having to reload the page so Iâ€™m not dependent on continuous internet connection.
5. As a student I want to add my own flashcards with a question and an answer so I can test myself with questions that I personally struggle with.
6. As a student I want to be able to delete flashcards so I can keep testing myself with relevant questions.
7. As a student I want to be able to have different categories of flashcards, so I can study different subjects.
