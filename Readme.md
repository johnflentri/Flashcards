# Retry Assignment

This is an assignment to see wether you can build a simple application in vanilla JavaScript on your own. Completing large parts of the userstories below gives us confidence in that you have achieved mastery over the basics of JavaScript.

We've included some starter files to start you off in the right direction. Please build on top of our suggestions.

When you are ready, push it github and send a link to teachers@codaisseur.com and send a slack message to the student examinator (Rein at this time).

## Show us your process - using git

We're not only interested in the final result we want to see what your process was in getting to it.

- Commit multiple times during this assignment
- Make at least 1 commit per userstory

If you do not provide a git history of your work the assignment can not be regarded as satisfactory.

## Requirements

The requirements of the app come from the user's perspective you can implement as you see fit. However, we would like to see DOM manipulation as part of the app.

You have to build a flash card app. Flash cards are cards with a question on one side an an answer on the other. It's a tool used to learn vocabulary words when learning languages for example. You're making an app where people can make digital flashcards of which they can see the question and answer.

## Userstories

1. As a student I want to see a random question so I can test myself
2. As a student I want to access the flashcard app from the internet so I can test myself anywhere I am (you can put the website online using netlify or github pages).
3. As a student I want to see the answer to the question so I can see if I was right.
4. As a student I want to get a new questions without having to reload the page so Iâ€™m not dependent on continuous internet connection.
5. As a student I want to add my own flashcards with a question and an answer so I can test myself with questions that I personally struggle with.
6. As a student I want to be able to delete flashcards so I can keep testing myself with relevant questions.
7. As a student I want to be able to have different categories of flashcards, so I can study different subjects.
